Almost exactly 18 months ago we released Tailwind CSS v1.0, which signalled a commitment to stability while continuing to push the boundaries with exciting new features in every minor release.

Over the course of those 18 months we released nine minor versions that added features like placeholder styling, screenreader visibility, CSS grid, transitions, transforms, animations, layout utilities, integrated tree-shaking, gradients, and tons more.

Today we're finally releasing Tailwind CSS v2.0.
